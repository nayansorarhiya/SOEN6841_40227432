# Project Management Learning Journal
### Overview
Welcome to the 12-week journal documenting my journey in software project management. This journal serves as a reflection on my experiences, challenges, and learnings throughout the development of our project.

### Week1
In Week 1, I grasped the essence of defining projects, understanding their unique characteristics, and honing project management skills tailored for software projects. Engaging in discussions with peers allowed me to explore adaptive strategies for addressing challenges like invisibility and flexibility in software projects. Additionally, I worked on refining my skills in crafting project charters, defining comprehensive project scopes, and setting clear objectives, all crucial for successful project initiation. To overcome challenges faced, I engaged in extra reading and online workshops, aiming to deepen my understanding and contribute effectively to group discussions. Looking ahead, my goals included achieving a deeper understanding of adapting management approaches and enhancing proficiency in project initiation activities.

### Week2
Week 2 saw me diving into effort and cost estimating methodologies essential for efficient project planning and resource allocation in software projects. Concepts like Delphi technique, Function Point Analysis (FPA), and COCOMO framework were explored, offering insights into empirical cost estimation and strategies for intelligent project planning. Interacting with peers provided valuable perspectives on effort and cost estimation, while personal development activities focused on deepening my understanding of algorithmic cost modeling principles and exploring advanced techniques for resource estimation and allocation. Challenges persisted, particularly in grasping complexities of algorithmic cost modeling and clarifying the application of estimation techniques in specific project scenarios. Despite these challenges, my goals for the upcoming week remained centered on deepening my understanding of COCOMO sub-models and further exploring advanced estimation techniques.
